msgid "Package capabilities"

msgid "Version dependencies"

msgid "Checking dependencies"
msgstr ""

msgid "Triggers"
msgstr ""

msgid "Packages aren’t built in a vacuum. Web applications, for example, build on system networking libraries, system-encryption libraries, and system-file input and output libraries."
msgstr ""

msgid "This chapter covers dependencies between packages, along with ways to discover and manage those dependencies."
msgstr ""

msgid "Understanding the Dependency Concept"
msgstr ""

msgid "A dependency occurs when one package depends on another. You might think it would make for an easier-to-manage system if no package depended on any others, but you’d face a few problems, not the least of which would be dramatically increased disk usage."
msgstr ""

msgid "Packages on your Linux system depend on other packages. Just about every package with an application, for example, depends on the system C libraries, since these libraries provide common facilities that just about every program uses. Network applications typically depend on low-level networking libraries. These dependencies really work in your favor, since a security bug fix in the network libraries can update all applications that make use of the updated libraries."
msgstr ""

msgid "Furthermore, sharing software means that each package has less code to maintain and thus improved quality. Code sharing has been in the computer lexicon since the 1960s."
msgstr ""

msgid "Although quite a few packages depend on system-level libraries, some packages depend on applications defined in other packages. The Emacs text editor package, for example, depends on the Perl scripting language, specifically, the perl command. Database client programs usually depend on the database server applications."
msgstr ""

msgid "The RPM database tracks dependency information, so it can, for example, stop attempts to remove packages that other packages depend on or inform users of dependent packages upon installation."
msgstr ""

msgid "Capabilities"
msgstr ""

msgid "In RPM terminology, each package provides capabilities. A capability is simply a text string that the package claims it provides. In most cases, a capability names a file or a package. But the capability can be any arbitrary text string."
msgstr ""

msgid "Other packages can then depend on certain capabilities. (You can use this concept in building your own packages.) Each package lists the capabilities it requires as well as the capabilities it provides."
msgstr ""

msgid "Cross Reference"
msgstr ""

msgid "Package dependencies and capabilities are very important when creating spec files for building your own RPM packages, the subject of <xref linkend=\"ch-specfiles\" /> ."
msgstr ""

msgid "When you install a package, the capability information is stored in the RPM database. When you remove a package, the rpm command checks the RPM database. If the package you are trying to remove provides a capability that another package needs, the command will generate an error. If you try to remove a package that other packages depend on, you'll see an error like the following:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""

msgid "To verify that the package has not been removed, you can query for the package after trying to remove it, as shown following:"
msgstr ""

msgid "# rpm -q setup"
msgstr ""

msgid "setup-2.8.20-1"
msgstr ""

msgid "This shows that the rpm command has not removed the setup package due to the errors."
msgstr ""

msgid "Forcing RPM actions"
msgstr ""

msgid "<xref linkend=\"ch-using-rpm\" /> covers ways to force the rpm command to do what you want, although this can cause problems if you try to force the issue and remove a crucial package. In virtually all cases, do not use any of the force options, as this can cause problems with the RPM system, since the force options are purposely ignoring safety checks performed by the rpm command."
msgstr ""

msgid "Many capabilities that packages require are system libraries, especially shared libraries. Shared libraries, which usually have a .so file extension (short for shared object), provide a memory-efficient means for applications to share program code. These libraries may also have a .so.number extension, such as libc.so.6."
msgstr ""

msgid "About shared libraries"
msgstr ""

msgid "Shared libraries on Windows are called DLLs, short for Dynamic Link Libraries. The implementations differ, but the Windows DLL concept is similar to Linux and Unix shared objects."
msgstr ""

msgid "Shared libraries have been part of Linux for a long time and have nothing to do with the RPM system. Shared libraries accessed by a program, however, represent natural dependencies. Because so many programs depend on shared libraries, the RPM system can automatically handle many shared-library dependencies."
msgstr ""

msgid "To list the shared libraries that a program accesses, use the ldd command, for example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"\n"
"        $ ldd /bin/grep\n"
"        linux-vdso.so.1 =&gt;  (0x00007fffcb90d000)\n"

"      "
msgstr ""

msgid "An application may depend on a capability provided by another package. It may also depend on the capability that a specific version of another package provides. For example, some add-ons to the Apache Web server depend on the version of Apache. The Apache 2.0 version made a number of changes that affect add-on packages. Some Apache add-on packages depend on version 1.3; others depend on version 2.0."
msgstr ""

msgid "Most package dependencies assume some level of compatibility and require a version at or above a given version number (for example, version 2.0 or later). You’ll see more version dependencies when applications make major changes, such as the change from 1.3 to 2.0 for the Apache Web server."
msgstr ""

msgid "Conflicts"
msgstr ""

msgid "Some packages may provide capabilities that interfere with those in other packages. This is called a conflict. Installing conflicting packages is an error. For example, the httpd package (the Apache Web server) conflicts with the thttpd package. Both packages want to provide the primary Web server for a system."
msgstr ""

msgid "The RPM system will prevent you from installing packages that conflict with other packages. You can force the issue, using the techniques described in <xref linkend=\"ch-using-rpm\" /> , and override the RPM system. But in most cases, you should not install packages that conflict."
msgstr ""

msgid "Obsoletes"
msgstr ""

msgid "The RPM system supports one more type of dependency, called obsoletes. This refers to a capability that a package provides that makes another capability obsolete. For example, a new version of the perl interpreter may make an older version obsolete. In most cases, the obsoletes dependency should be used when the name of a package changes. For example, the apache Web server package became the httpd package. You would expect the new package, httpd, to obsolete the old package name, apache."
msgstr ""

msgid "This brings the total to four types of dependencies that the RPM system tracks:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Requires, which tracks the capabilities a package requires"
msgstr ""

msgid "Provides, which tracks the capabilities a package provides for other packages"
msgstr ""

msgid "Conflicts, which describes the capabilities that if installed, conflict with capabilities in a package"
msgstr ""

msgid "Obsoletes, which describes the capabilities that this package will make obsolete"
msgstr ""

msgid "Packages advertise this dependency information. Each dependency holds the type, such as requires, a capability, such as a shared library or a package name, and optionally a version number, such as requiring the python package at a version number greater than or equal to 2.2 (python &gt;= 2.2)."
msgstr ""

msgid "Checking for Dependencies"
msgstr ""

msgid "The rpm –q command queries the RPM database or RPM package files. With the right options to this command, you can check for the four types of package dependencies as well. These options are based on the concept of capabilities introduced previously."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can query what capabilities a package requires. You can also query what capabilities a package provides. You can query for the obsoleting and conflicting information as well. Furthermore, given a capability, you can query which packages require this capability as well as which packages provide this capability."
msgstr ""

msgid "There are quite a few more options you can use with the rpm –q command for querying packages. See <xref linkend=\"ch-using-rpm-db\" /> for more on querying packages and package files."
msgstr ""

msgid "Determining the capabilities a package requires"
msgstr ""

msgid "The first and most important step is to determine what capabilities a package requires. If all the required capabilities are met, you can safely install the package (barring other things that can go wrong, such as conflicts). The requires dependencies are by far the most important."
msgstr ""

msgid "The --requires option to the rpm –q command lists the capabilities a given package requires. The basic syntax is:"
msgstr ""

msgid "rpm –q query_options --requires packages"

The sendmail package depends on a lot of other parts of the system, as you can see in the response to the command shown previously. Most of the dependencies are for system libraries (all the dependencies ending in .so or .so.number). This package requires other capabilities (packages in this case). It also requires the chkconfig package at a specific version, version 1.3 or higher, and the bash package at version 2.0 or higher. The sendmail package also requires a particular version of the RPM system (the rpmlib dependency)."

This is a more stringent requirement than just depending on the given packages being installed. This RPM is also an older RPM package, based on the requirement for the rpmlib to be prior or equal to 3.0.4-1."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid "Determining the capabilities a package provides"
msgstr ""

msgid "Packages require capabilities, and they can provide capabilities for other packages to require. To list the capabilities a package provides, use the --provides option. These capabilities can be arbitrary names, shared libraries (.so files), and the package name itself. The basic syntax is:"
