msgid "Extending RPM management with additional tools"
msgstr ""

msgid "You can find a variety of software packages to ease the work of managing RPM-based systems. These utilities can help you find a specific software application packaged using RPM or search through a collection of RPM-packaged software to locate applications with specific features. Similarly, several utilities provide features to ease long-term system-management tasks. These applications provide features such as automatic updating of existing installed software with more recent versions or simplification of software installation by automating installation of any required software dependencies."
msgstr ""

msgid "This chapter covers a number of tools for finding packages in RPM format, as well as tools to help manage the RPMs on your system."
msgstr ""

msgid "Locating RPMs"
msgstr ""

msgid "RPM provides a powerful tool for managing software installed on a system. With a single command, an entire application can be installed on the system in a ready-to-run configuration. With a different command, the entire application can be removed without having manually to track down all of the associated files scattered throughout the hard drive. For RPM to work, however, the software being managed must be packaged in the proper RPM format. RPM packages can be easily prepared if necessary, but you can save time by using the wide variety of software already available in the RPM format. The only trick to using this RPM-packaged software is finding it."
msgstr ""

msgid "As you start to search for RPM packages on the Internet, you’ll find thousands of packages available. Many of these packages are built specifically for various Linux distributions, such as Conectiva, SUSE, Red Hat, or Mandrake. In many cases, the Linux distribution won’t matter, but in general it's best to download packages built for your version of Linux, such as Red Hat."
msgstr ""

msgid "Note"
msgstr ""

msgid "Although the examples in this book assume Red Hat Linux as a base, just about everything applies to all versions of Linux that use the RPM system, unless noted otherwise."
msgstr ""

msgid "Internet search engines are popular, but they aren’t very helpful for finding RPM packages, especially because lots of Web pages have the term rpm (including those covering revolutions per minute). A more efficient approach is to use one of the RPM-specific Internet search tools such as rpmfind."
msgstr ""

msgid "rpmfind and rpm2html"
msgstr ""

msgid "One popular free tool for locating RPMs is rpmfind, written by Daniel Veillard. This tool provides a command-line utility that can search for packages by name or description, displaying or optionally downloading any matching packages it finds. It can even provide a list of the dependencies that those matching packages require to run and can download those required dependencies as well."
msgstr ""

msgid "When searching for packages, rpmfind can search both the software already installed on the local system and remote databases, including the databases located at http://rpmfind.net/."
msgstr ""

msgid "The databases at http://rpmfind.net/ are, in turn, created by another utility: rpm2html. Both are covered in the sections following."
msgstr ""

msgid "Commonly, rpmfind is used to search for packages by name, though it can be used to search package descriptions for key words. For example, I might want to find new e-mail clients to install on my system. I happen to know that one popular Linux e-mail client is Ximian’s evolution, so I search for that."
msgstr ""

msgid "The basic syntax for rpmfind follows:"
msgstr ""

msgid "rpmfind package_name"
msgstr ""

msgid "For example, to search for evolution, use a command like the following:"
msgstr ""

msgid "$ rpmfind evolution"
msgstr ""

msgid "Resource evolution already installed"
msgstr ""

msgid "$"
msgstr ""

msgid "Before accessing the Internet, rpmfind searches my local system and finds that I already have evolution installed, so it does not even bother searching for copies to download. It looks like I’m forgetful, not remembering that I already have evolution installed. At this point, I might realize that I already have the software I need, or I might decide to search for a similar application, such as exmh, another popular Unix e-mail client."
msgstr ""

msgid "To search for exmh (which in this example has not been installed), use a command like the following:"
msgstr ""

msgid "$ rpmfind exmh"
msgstr ""

msgid "Installing exmh will require 7301 KBytes"

msgstr ""

msgid "Here, rpmfind searches my local system for exmh. Since exmh is not installed there, rpmfind searches the databases at http://rpmfind.net/ and does two things: it finds exmh, and it learns that exmh depends upon another package: nmh. After double-checking and learning that nmh is not installed on my local system, rpmfind gives me a choice regarding whether I should download both of those packages; rpmfind gives me four possible answers:"

msgstr ""

msgid "Any user can download packages, but usually only the root user can install packages. Unless you are logged in as root, rpmfind will likely fail to install the downloaded RPMs."
msgstr ""

msgid "Because I select the \"a\" answer, rpmfind downloads all necessary packages to /tmp and tries to upgrade the packages automatically by running the following command:"
msgstr ""

msgid "In this case, the rpm -U command silently fails, since I am not running it as root and do not have permission to install software."

Some of the packages found are prepared for the distribution I am running (Red Hat Linux version 7.2), but others are not.

Finally, the page includes a download link to download the RPM file."
msgstr ""

msgid "All packages of the same name, such as the exmh e-mail client, are collected on summary pages. The summary page tries to list all RPMs for all Linux distributions that provide the given package. For exmh, for example, the database as of this writing includes 71 versions of the exmh package, for Conectiva Linux, Mandrake Linux, Yellow Dog PowerPC Linux, and so on. The summary page also links to the URL in the RPMs that is listed as the home page for the application."

msgid "Used together with its database, rpm2html provides a powerful RPM-centric search engine. You can find more on rpm2html at rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/ or just access an RPM search site such as rpmfind.net."
msgstr ""

msgid "In addition to rpm2html, the program pdbv creates a set of cross-linked HTML files that list the packages on your system. Pdbv doesn’t support searching and wasn’t built as a front end for search sites, so it is simpler than rpm2html. Instead, pdbv just creates a set of HTML pages that list data that you can query with the rpm command, including the package descriptions, the capabilities required and provided, as well as all the files in the package."

msgstr ""

msgid "RPM makes it very easy to install and uninstall software from systems. One simple command installs an entire application onto the computer, and another removes all files associated with an application. Using RPM to install and uninstall software can become tedious in some situations, however. Manually installing software on one system is no great task, but what if that same software package needs to be installed on all the computers in the department? Or on all the computers in a company? Suddenly, that one rpm -i command has become a major chore!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Similarly, keeping one system up-to-date with the latest vendor errata, although an extremely important administrative task, is not terribly time-consuming or difficult — simply download all the errata and associated packages from the vendor; then use the command rpm -Fvh to install the packages on the system, freshening all installed software with the latest updates of that software."
msgstr ""

msgid "If several machines are being managed, though, the task becomes slightly more difficult. Now the vendor errata and packages must be manually copied to each machine, and rpm -Fvh must be run on each machine to update it. If many machines are being managed, and those systems are running different versions of the operating system (so that they require different errata), the task becomes even more complicated. Separate errata packages must be downloaded for every operating system version in use; then the appropriate errata collections must be pushed to each machine and manually freshened. To make life as a system administrator even more frustrating, sometimes vendor-supplied errata cannot be installed using the freshen option. A package supplied as one RPM in the initial operating-system release might be split into two RPMs for the errata, for example. When this happens, freshen cannot be used. Instead, the administrator must determine what software is currently installed on the system, and the errata for that software must be manually installed. Typically, this involves several rounds of comparing output from rpm -qa with the list of current errata, using rpm -Uvh to upgrade only the appropriate errata for that system."
msgstr ""

msgid "Worse yet, errata updating should ideally be done on an automatic basis. While rpm commands can be scheduled using system utilities such as cron or at, obviously this cannot be done when the rpm commands to be scheduled need to be interactive."
msgstr ""

msgid "Installation of new packages can pose problems as well. New software will often have logical dependencies upon other software that is also not currently installed. Although RPM does track software dependencies, it does not magically find all dependencies an application needs, nor does it automatically install them along with the initial application. Instead, all required “helper” applications must be searched out and manually installed. Then the desired software can be installed."
msgstr ""

msgid "These and similar problems are very common in the real world. Typically, system administrators manage as many as 200 or more systems. Manually logging into 200 systems and executing an rpm -i command every time another application is needed is not practical. Even when managing one system, downloading errata and manually installing it regularly quickly becomes tedious."
msgstr ""

msgid "Like any regular system-administration task, it should be automated. When installing new software on machines, managing dependencies and downloading and installing required support software becomes tiresome as well."
msgstr ""

msgid "To aid with these common problems, a variety of helper applications are available for RPM. These management aids can perform functions such as automatically managing dependencies. When an application is being installed using one of these helpers, the utility also finds and installs any required dependencies. Similarly, when errata are being installed, these management aids can automatically determine which errata are needed by the current system, even in situations in which rpm -F does not work. Some of these tools can even be used to manage clusters of computers. Running one command applies the RPM install or delete on the entire group of machines. All of these commands are designed with scriptability in mind, making them perfect for use automatically via tools such as cron or at."

msgstr ""

msgid "One popular tool to lessen the work involved with administering RPM-based systems is AutoRPM. Written by Kirk Bauer, AutoRPM is available under a free MIT-style license from the home page www.autorpm.org."
msgstr ""

msgid "A Perl script, AutoRPM provides several features that make it especially useful. First, it can create local mirrors of RPM repositories. Typically, this feature might be used to create a local archive of errata for a Linux distribution. AutoRPM can also compare all currently installed RPMs against a list stored elsewhere. This list can be either an FTP site or a directory on the local system. After comparing the currently-installed RPMs against the list, AutoRPM can then update any packages from the list site that are newer than what is installed on the local system. This way, you can define one site or directory as the master site of the package versions that need to get installed on all systems and let AutoRPM ensure that all computers on your network are up to date."
msgstr ""

msgid "Together, these two functions make AutoRPM very convenient for keeping systems current with all errata the vendor releases. They can also be used to create a method of distributing software to a network of systems. For example, every workstation in the department can run AutoRPM, configured to watch a common directory on a local NFS server. Installing new software on every workstation in the department occurs simply by copying an RPM of the software into that directory, letting AutoRPM do the rest of the work."
msgstr ""

msgid "AutoRPM is designed to be used both automatically from cron and interactively from the command line. By default, AutoRPM runs via a nightly cron job and downloads all updates for software currently installed on the system. It then stores these updates in a local directory, typically /var/spool/autorpm, and e-mails an administrator a notification on the new updates. The administrator can then log onto the system and manually install the updates using the rpm command. AutoRPM can also be easily configured to install automatically any new packages it downloads. If AutoRPM is so configured, the system administrator does not even have to log in and run rpm commands to keep the system up-to-date!"

These other machines have AutoRPM configured to install all files that the file server exports. Using a configuration such as this, all machines in the enterprise get all security updates automatically installed. In addition, installing a desired new software application on all hosts in the enterprise can be done simply by copying an RPM of the application onto the file server, making it available for the AutoRPM nightly updates to access and install automatically."

msgid "Some vendors of RPM-based Linux distributions also provide utilities that can help with management of the distributions they create. Red Hat has created two complementary products, the Red Hat Network (RHN) and up2date, which together provide much the same functionality for managing Red Hat Linux installations as tools such as AutoUpdate and AutoRPM, as well as offering more advanced features."
msgstr ""

msgid "Red Hat Network is a subscription-based service offered by Red Hat Red Hat Network makes software available for installation via the network. (A free evaluation is also available.) After registering machines with Red Hat Network, administrators can pull updates or new software for installation to those registered machines. In addition, administrators have access to a Web-based administrative console from which they can view the systems they manage and can push software out to those systems."
msgstr ""

msgid "Red Hat offers two tiers of access to Red Hat Network. Basic Service subscriptions to Red Hat Network provide the ability to manage single systems. Multiple machines can be subscribed by the same administrator for Basic Service level Red Hat Network access, but they must all be managed independently. The administrator must push out errata to each machine separately. Workgroup Service subscriptions provide the same functionality as Basic Service subscriptions, but they also provide the ability to group multiple machines for simultaneous administration. All errata updates for all machines subscribed to Workgroup Service can be pushed out by a single action, for example. Furthermore, Workgroup Service subscriptions can allow management by multiple administrators if desired, making it possible for large organizations to share responsibilities among administrators."
msgstr ""

msgid "When using Red Hat Network to manage machines with Workgroup Service subscriptions, Red Hat also offers two optional services: Red Hat Network Proxy Server and Red Hat Network Satellite. The Red Hat Network Proxy Server is, as its name suggests, a proxy server for the Red Hat Network. Using it, errata pushed out via Red Hat Network is downloaded by the organization (only once) to a central server in-house. All machines in that organization subscribed to Red Hat Network get their updated software from that in-house proxy server, significantly reducing the network bandwidth requirements needed to keep large organizations up to date."
msgstr ""

msgid "In addition, the Red Hat Network Proxy Server can be used to provide all subscribed machines with software not provided with Red Hat Linux. Custom “channels” of supplemental software can be created on the Proxy Server, and machines can be subscribed to those channels as desired. Using this feature, different departments in the organization with different software needs can create independent channels for each department, ensuring that machines get only the software needed on them. Similarly, distinct channels can be created for separate classes of machines, ensuring that servers get only software appropriate for server machines and that desktops only get only software that desktop machines need."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Red Hat Network is normally centrally administered through Red Hat. Machines subscribed to the Red Hat Network have a system profile on file with Red Hat that details the system’s essential configuration information (what software is installed on it, what CPU architecture it contains, and so forth) needed to determine which software errata are appropriate for that system. Similarly, the Web console through which machines subscribed to Red Hat Network can be administered is also located on a Red Hat server. Customers wishing to use Red Hat Network services, but not wanting the dependency upon Internet access to Red Hat, can create an in-house Red Hat Network by using the Red Hat Network Satellite. This solution is often practical for customers who need to keep system information confidential or for customers whose systems are not able to access the Internet."
msgstr ""

msgid "Red Hat provides several interfaces for administering machines subscribed to the Red Hat Network. A Web-management console is available at https://rhn.redhat.com/. Administrators of machines subscribed to any level of the Red Hat Network can simply log into this Web site and perform a variety of package-management operations from their Web browsers. In addition to viewing other things, administrators can see what software is currently installed, select and install Red Hat Linux errata or new software, or schedule a time for automatic installation of Red Hat Linux errata."
msgstr ""

msgid "When using Red Hat Network, rhnsd is a client-side daemon that should be run on subscribed systems. It periodically launches a helper utility, rhn_check, which connects to the Red Hat Network servers and checks for any actions (such as a scheduled installation of errata) that an administrator has selected in the Web console. If any actions have been scheduled for that client machine, rhn_check on the client initiates those actions. By default, rhnsd runs rhn_check every two hours. This time can be increased to check for configuration changes as frequently as every hour if necessary."
msgstr ""

msgid "In addition, Red Hat provides client-side tools that can be used in a more interactive fashion to connect to the Red Hat Network from subscribed systems. The up2date program provides a graphical and command-line tool that can be used to install packages from Red Hat Network servers. When installing a new package, up2date automatically installs any necessary dependencies the package requires, making it a very convenient tool for adding software to the system. up2date can also be run in update mode, thus telling it to install all updates available for the software already installed on the system.

This suite of applications is typically referred to as urpmi and includes both the urpmi command and several helper applications. urpmi itself is a command that acts as a wrapper around the rpm command.

msgid "Mandrake’s urpmi program includes one very handy feature. It comes with an autoirpm helper utility that can be used to configure the system to install packages on demand. This is done by running the command autoirpm.update-all, an application that scans all packages available for installation via urpmi. For every package available through urpmi, autoirpm.update-all determines what executable programs it provides, and it creates a symbolic link from that executable’s name to the autoirpm script. Attempting to execute such a symbolic link executes autoirpm, which in turn automatically uses urpmi to install the associated package. The result: on-demand installation of packages when users on the system attempt to execute the programs that those packages provide."

The group uses a different package format, dpkg, which was developed independently of and simultaneous to Red Hat’s creation of RPM. The two formats, dpkg and RPM, are very similar in terms of utility and functionality. In addition to having created a package format, the Debian Project later developed a collection of software, apt, which could be used to manage and install dpkg-format software. And, since Debian distributions are typically installed over the Internet, this apt software has to supply advanced distributed package management functionality."
msgstr ""

msgid "In many respects, Debian’s implementation of apt is very similar to the functionality provided by Red Hat’s up2date/Red Hat Network products or Mandrake’s urpmi software. On Debian systems, apt is a client tool used to select and install new software packages or to update existing packages already installed on the system. To do this, it accesses a user-configured list of resources that supply new packages; these resources are typically the Debian Project’s FTP or Web servers, though they can also be CD-ROMs or local or remote file systems. For apt to be able to download packages from a resource such as a CD-ROM or an FTP server, that resource must supply two things: the software packages being downloaded and a database supplying metadata about all the packages in the repository. These resource databases are essential for apt to operate. For this reason, apt can only be used to update systems from apt-capable repositories."
msgstr ""

msgid "Although apt was created by the Debian Project and designed for dpkg-format software packages, nothing about apt requires that it inherently be usable only with dpkg-format packages. Because of this, and because of its powerful capabilities, Conectiva, a Brazilian Linux distribution vendor (www.conectiva.com), extended apt to support management of RPM packages in addition to dpkg packages. Conectiva’s work, commonly referred to as apt-rpm, makes the apt client software available for use on any RPM-based Linux distribution. Conectiva also provides its customers with access to apt-capable FTP servers. A related project, apt4rpm (http://apt4rpm.sourceforge.net/), supplies the necessary utilities that can be used to make any RPM repository apt-capable. By creating apt-capable servers using apt4rpm and then installing apt-rpm on the client systems, any RPM-based distribution, such as Red Hat Linux, Mandrake Linux, Caldera/SCO OpenLinux, or SUSE Linux, can then be easily managed using apt."

To use apt, administrators must install it on their machines and have access to an apt-capable RPM repository for the distribution they use. Several public FTP sites that support apt are now available for most of the major RPM-based distributions. Also, the administrator can create another apt-capable repository."
