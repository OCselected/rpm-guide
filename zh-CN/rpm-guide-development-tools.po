msgid "Linux Text Editors and Development Tools"
msgstr "Linux 文本编辑器和开发工具"

msgid "This appendix covers:"
msgstr "此附录涵盖有："

msgid "General text editors"
msgstr "通用文本编辑器"

msgid "C-specific tools and integrated development environments"
msgstr "C 语言特定的工具和集成开发环境"

msgid "Python-specific development tools"
msgstr ""

msgid "Linux includes a number of text editors and integrated development environments (IDEs), going from plain old text editors all the way up to sophisticated tools. These tools are suitable for shell scripting, C, Python, and Perl programming, along with a plethora of other uses. Linux makes extensive use of text files, especially for configuration data, so Linux has always included a number of text editors."
msgstr ""

msgid "This appendix lists a number of tools for those who have not yet set up an RPM development environment on Linux. Note that choosing an editor or IDE is mostly a matter of personal taste. Programmers will often engage in raging battles over the superiority of text editors and other programming tools. Before searching around too far, try out what you have installed on your system and see if that works for you."
msgstr ""

msgid "Note that Internet sites may change or disappear, so you may have to search to find these tools."
msgstr ""

msgid "General Text Editors"
msgstr ""

msgid "Linux distributions include a number of text editors with varying sets of features. The two most common editors are vi and emacs, which come with virtually all Linux distributions. These editors are good for UNIX- or Linux-savvy developers, but generally have a steep learning curve for developers used only to Windows."
msgstr ""

msgid "If you come from Windows, try gedit, kedit, or kate. These text editors open a graphical window on your desktop, making them appear more or less like the Windows Notepad.exe. All three offer more features than Notepad.exe, however."
msgstr ""

msgid "You may not have installed any of these editors, but all are available as part of Red Hat Linux. You can install vi, emacs, gedit, kedit, or kate from the packages that come with your Linux distribution."
msgstr ""

msgid "To start one of the editors, enter a command like the following:"
msgstr ""

msgid "$ gedit listrpmpkgs &amp;"
msgstr ""

msgid "The ampersand, &amp;, launches the program in the background. Replace gedit with the editor you choose."
msgstr ""

msgid "Programming Text Editors"
msgstr ""

msgid "In addition to general-purpose text editors, Linux sports a large number of text editors with special features for programming, such as syntax highlighting. The extended version of vi, called vim, includes a number of add-ons that can help you with C programming tasks. Emacs also includes a wide array of features to help programming. Both of these editors can act as development environments with a bit of configuration. As mentioned previously, both come with most Linux distributions."
msgstr ""

msgid "I also like an editor called nedit and another one called jedit. The jedit editor is written in Java, so that it runs the same on Windows and Linux, a big win if you must work on multiple platforms. (Emacs and vim have versions that work on Windows, too, along with Linux.) If you use jedit, you must have a Java runtime environment installed."
msgstr ""

msgid "Cross Reference"
msgstr ""

msgid "Download nedit from www.nedit.org. Download jedit from www.jedit.org. Download Java runtime environments from Sun at http://java.sun.com/j2se/downloads.html or IBM at www.ibm.com/java/jdk/ and select the IBM Developer Kit for Linux."
msgstr ""

msgid "Integrated Development Environments for C Programming"
msgstr ""

msgid "If you want more of a graphical environment, Red Hat Linux ships with KDevelop, an IDE for C and C++ programming."
msgstr ""

msgid "Anjuta provides a GTK/GNOME-based IDE, an alternative to the KDE-based KDevelop. KDevelop, however, supports KDE, GNOME, Qt, and text-mode C and C++ applications."
msgstr ""

msgid "Download Anjuta from www.anjuta.org."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Eclipse IDE, while mostly used for Java development, has a C and C++ mode called CDT, for C/C++ Development Tools. Eclipse is important because Red Hat provides an RPM-building plug-in to Eclipse."
msgstr ""

msgid "Download Anjuta from www.anjuta.org. Download Eclipse from www.eclipse.org and the Eclipse CDT from www.eclipse.org/tools/downloads.html."
msgstr ""

msgid "Integrated Development Environments for Python Programming"
msgstr ""

msgid "As with C programs, Python scripts are made up of text files holding Python commands, so you need a text editor or some sort of development environment for creating Python programs. Any of the tools listed so far will work fine for developing Python applications. The key requirement is the ability to control tabs and indenting, since this is crucial to Python syntax."
msgstr ""

msgid "IDLE, a graphical console and editor, supports creating Python applications. This is considered part of Python. IDLE requires the Python-tools package."
msgstr ""

msgid "In addition, you can choose from Python-focused tools such as Bicycle Repair Man, a refactoring tool, or Boa Constructor and Black Adder, two Python IDEs."
msgstr ""

msgid "Boa Constructor is available from http://boa-constructor.sourceforge.net. Black Adder is a commercial tool available at www.thekompany.com."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Eclipse IDE, mentioned previously, supports a number of Python add-ons. Combined with the C and C++ tools, and plug-ins for building RPMs, Eclipse brings together most everything you need for Python development on Linux."
msgstr ""

msgid "Eclipse is available at www.eclipse.org, and Python add-ons at http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyeclipse, http://sourceforge.net/projects/pe4eclipse, or http://www.kalab.com/freeware/pythoneclipse/pythoneclipse.htm."
msgstr ""

msgid "This is really just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Python tools. You can find many more available on the Internet."
msgstr ""

msgid "A large listing of Python editing tools appears at http://www.python.org/cgi-bin/moinmoin/PythonEditors."
