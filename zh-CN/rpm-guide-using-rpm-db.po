msgid "Verifying installed packages"

msgid "Backing up the RPM database"

msgid "Repairing damaged RPM databases"
msgstr ""

msgid "Every package you install with RPM is recorded in the RPM database. The RPM system includes commands to query this database to find out which packages are installed and to provide quite a few details about these packages."
msgstr ""

msgid "This chapter covers querying both the RPM database and RPM package files. Both types of query are important:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Query the RPM database to see what is installed, or not installed, on your system."
msgstr ""

msgid "Query package files to see what the files require, as well as what the files provide."
msgstr ""

msgid "In addition to querying the RPM database, you can use the database to verify packages. Since this database is so important to the management of your Linux system, this chapter covers how to back it up, as well as how to repair a damaged RPM database."
msgstr ""

msgid "Querying the RPM Database"
msgstr ""

msgid "In <xref linkend=\"ch-using-rpm\" /> , you saw that the rpm command usually takes one major command-line option to tell it the operation to perform and a myriad of command-line options to customize the operation. The rpm command may also take the name of one or more RPM package files or the name of one or more installed packages. For example, the <command>rpm –i</command> command performs an installation operation, and the <command>rpm –U</command> command performs an upgrade."
msgstr ""

msgid "For querying the RPM database, the major command-line option is <literal>–q</literal>, short for query. This option tells the rpm command to query the RPM database. You can also use the long option <literal>--query</literal>."
msgstr ""

msgid "In the last few chapters, you've used the <literal>–q</literal> option with the rpm command to query just for the presence or absence of installed packages. You can expand the <literal>-q</literal> option to perform a wide array of queries to find out information about the packages installed on a Linux system."
msgstr ""

msgid "Querying packages"
msgstr ""

msgid "The basic format of the <command>rpm –q</command> command follows:"
msgstr ""

msgid "<command>rpm –q <replaceable>package_name</replaceable></command>"
msgstr ""

msgid "You need to provide the name of a package to query. For example:"
msgstr ""

msgid "<command>rpm -q telnet-0.17</command>"
msgstr ""

msgid "This command returns the name of the package, if installed. For example:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"\n"
"        telnet-0.17-20\n"
"      "
msgstr ""

msgid "If the package is not installed, you’ll see a message like the following:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"\n"
"        package telnet-0.17 is not installed\n"
"      "
msgstr ""

msgid "You can provide the whole package name to the rpm command, which includes the name, the version, and the RPM package number, as discussed in <xref linkend=\"ch-rpm-overview\" /> . You can also just provide the name and version number, as shown previously, or just the base name of the package."
msgstr ""

msgid "For example, the following command uses just the base name of the package:"
msgstr ""

msgid "<command>rpm -q telnet</command>"
msgstr ""

msgid "The rpm –q command expects a package name. Although it supports some amount of customized queries, you really need to know which packages you want the rpm command to report on."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can provide more than one package name; the rpm command reports on each package, as shown following."

msgstr ""

msgid "Querying everything"
msgstr ""

msgid "Up to now, we have used the rpm command to query only for specific packages. The <literal>–a</literal> option tells the rpm command to query for all packages. You can also use the longer option, <literal>--all</literal>, in place of <literal>–a</literal>."
msgstr ""

msgid "When you query all the installed packages, you get too much output for most purposes, other than to get a general idea of the magnitude of packages installed on your system. But if you cannot remember a package name, there's no real option, other than writing your own RPM query program."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can take advantage of the power of the Linux shells, though, and the wonderful ability to pipe the output of one command into another to work around this problem. With the large amount of output, you may want to pipe the output to the <command>more</command> or <command>less</command> programs, and display the output one page at a time."

msgid "There are quite a few other Linux commands you can use in pipelines with the <command>rpm –qa</command> command to better filter and display the data, such as <command>wc –l</command> to count the number of packages that you query.

msgid "Finding which packages own files"

msgid "One of the common problems with package management comes when you want to track a given file on your system back to the package that “owns” the file (that is, the package that, when installed, installed the particular file)."
msgstr ""

msgid "The <option>-qf</option> option tells the rpm command to query for all packages that own a particular file. You can also use the longer option, <option>--file</option>, in place of <option>–f</option>. The basic syntax follows:"
msgstr ""

msgid "<command>rpm -qf <replaceable>filename</replaceable></command>"
msgstr ""

msgid "For example, the grep command used in previous examples is really a file. (Just about all Linux commands are a file of some sort, be it a shell script or an executable application.) You can use a few Linux commands to determine which package provides this handy program."
msgstr ""

msgid "First, we need the exact path to the file. For Linux commands, you can use the <command>which</command> command, if the program is in your path. (The grep program must be in your path, or commands with grep will fail.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Try the following command:"
msgstr ""

msgid "<command>which grep</command>"
msgstr ""

msgid "This command returns the path to grep:"

msgid "/bin/grep"

msgstr ""

msgid "<command>rpm -qf /bin/grep</command>"
msgstr ""

msgid "grep-2.6.3-1"
msgstr ""

msgid "You can also use the Linux back-tick operator to perform this check with one command."
msgstr ""

msgid "<command>rpm -qf `which grep`</command>"
msgstr ""

msgid "If you use the bash shell, you can use the $(command parameters) syntax in place of the back tick, or `, characters. For example:"
msgstr ""

msgid "<command>rpm -qf $(which grep)</command>"
msgstr ""

msgid "If no package owns a given file, you’ll see output like the following:"
msgstr ""

msgid "<command>rpm -qf mail</command>"
msgstr ""

msgid "file mail is not owned by any package"
msgstr ""

msgid "Often, the package that owns a file does not have an intuitive name. The ssh command, for example, is owned by the openssh-clients package, as shown following:"
msgstr ""

msgid "<command>rpm -qf `which ssh`</command>"
msgstr ""

msgid "openssh-clients-5.4p1-3"
msgstr ""

msgid "As you can see, the name of a command does not always correspond directly to the name of the package that provides that command. This is where the <command>rpm –qf</command> command proves very useful. Otherwise, you would just have to know that OpenSSH is the project responsible for this command."
msgstr ""

msgid "Symbolic Links"
msgstr ""

msgid "The <command>rpm -qf</command> command follows symbolic links. This was not always true with older versions of RPM, but modern RPM versions can trace package ownership to files placed in linked directories."
msgstr ""

msgid "For example, the directory /usr/lib/X11 is a link to the real directory, /usr/X11R6/lib/X11. You can track the package ownership of a file in that directory, XKeysymDB, for example, by using the following command:"
msgstr ""

msgid "<command>rpm -qf /usr/lib/X11/XKeysymDB</command>"
msgstr ""

msgid "XFree86-4.2.0-72"

msgstr ""

msgid "Describing packages"

msgid "The <option>–i</option> option with an rpm query command tells the rpm command to output descriptive information about the package. You can also use the longer option, <option>--info</option>, in place of <option>–i</option>. The basic syntax is:"
msgstr ""

msgid "<command>rpm -qi <replaceable>package</replaceable></command>"
msgstr ""

msgid "Warning"
msgstr ""

msgid "The order of the command-line options is very important. Remember that the rpm command has the following general syntax:"
msgstr ""

msgid "<command>rpm <replaceable>–MajorOperation</replaceable> <replaceable>–extra_options packages_or_files</replaceable></command>"
msgstr ""

msgid "<command>rpm –i</command> installs packages and <command>rpm –q</command> queries packages. The <command>rpm –qi</command> command outputs the descriptive information on packages.
